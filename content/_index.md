I'm Zach, a passionate Software Engineer who carefully crafts maintainable code that is secure, efficient, and actually delivers.

Outside of work I spend my time <code>sudo pacman -Syu</code>ing my personal devices, hanging out with my wife, designing and 3D printing knick-knacks, handwiring microcontrollers for keyboards, and of course being bad at video games.
